# Notes

Note 1: The dataset used in this project is a toy dataset for demonstration purposes only. The original dataset can be downloaded from https://scholar.cu.edu.eg/dataset_BUSI.zip for the actual training.

Note 2: The Pseudo B-Mode python code is a Python implementation of the matlab version https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34199-pseudo-b-mode-ultrasound-image-simulator

Note 3: The Pseudo B-Mode implementation method is based on the works of: Yongjian Yu, Acton, S.T., "Speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion," IEEE Trans. Image Processing, vol. 11, no. 11, pp. 1260-1270, Nov 2002.[http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2002.804276] and J. C. Bambre and R. J. Dickinson, "Ultrasonic B-scanning: A computersimulation", Phys. Med.
